BrightcoveOS .NET-MAPI-Wrapper Changelog
--------------

2011-12-05
Version: 1.20

- Significantly reduced memory usage when uploading large files. Files are now streamed to the server, rather than requiring that the file contents be loaded into memory.
- Note: The "Create" methods that accept a `byte[]` have been removed, so if your code was feeding-in bytes directly (rather than specifying a file on disk) then the version 1.2 update will require you change your code to specify a Stream in the following form, instead: `FileUploadInfo(Stream data, string fileName)`
