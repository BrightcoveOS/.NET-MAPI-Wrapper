About the .NET-MAPI-Wrapper
----------------
BrightcoveOS .NET-MAPI-Wrapper is a .NET wrapper for the [Brightcove](http://www.brightcove.com/) [Media API](http://support.brightcove.com/en/docs/media-api-reference). All available API calls are wrapped, for both video and audio.

Getting Started
----------------
1. Download the [latest release][latest-dll]. Extract the archive and place BrightcoveOS.NET-MAPI-Wrapper.dll in an appropriate place for inclusion in your project. 
	- Choose the debug dll while developing, since it is compiled with debug symbols, and will print raw information about the API calls to the .NET debug trace listener as the calls are made. 
	- For production environments, use the release version of the dll.
2. Add a reference to your project for the dll.
3. Add "using" statements to your code for the following namespaces:
	- using BrightcoveMapiWrapper.Api;
	- using BrightcoveMapiWrapper.Model;
	- using BrightcoveMapiWrapper.Model.Containers;
	- using BrightcoveMapiWrapper.Model.Items;
3. Create a BrightcoveApi object and make API calls!

Usage
----------------
A simple case, find all videos in an account: 

	// Instantiate an API object by using the provided factory
	BrightcoveApi api = BrightcoveApiFactory.CreateApi("my API read token");
	
	// NOTE: API calls are subject to the whims of internet connectivity, and may throw an exception for any number of reasons. 
	// NOTE: To ensure that your app is as robust as possible, make sure to try/catch all API calls (not shown here).
	
	// Perform the "find_all_videos" API call
	BrightcoveItemCollection<BrightcoveVideo> videos = api.FindAllVideos();	
	foreach (BrightcoveVideo video in videos)
	{
		// do something with each video
	}


All available API calls are [documented by Brightcove][brightcove-api-docs]; or see the [.NET-MAPI-Wrapper wiki][wiki] for more examples.
