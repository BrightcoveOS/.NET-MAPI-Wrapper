      <p begin="00:00:02.958" end="00:00:07.474">(bright music plays)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.474" end="00:00:11.120">- Really just stumbled<br />on them through a website</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.120" end="00:00:13.451">where they post medical<br />transcription jobs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.451" end="00:00:14.821">This other company was out there,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.821" end="00:00:17.737">saying, "Hey. We're looking<br />for transcriptionists."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.413" end="00:00:19.670">I clicked on it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.670" end="00:00:21.287">Moved very quickly.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.287" end="00:00:24.385">Within less than a week,<br />I was already working.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.385" end="00:00:26.804">- Rev is first and foremost a translation</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.804" end="00:00:28.692">and transcription agency</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.692" end="00:00:32.221">and flexibility is extremely<br />important to me as a student.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.221" end="00:00:33.932">We can claim jobs as we like,</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.932" end="00:00:37.020">or we can not claim jobs if<br />we don't have time to do them.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.020" end="00:00:41.534">- I'm getting paid to transcribe these</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.534" end="00:00:43.551">and I'm learning things.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.551" end="00:00:48.371">I've typed sermons, some<br />great, inspiring sermons.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.371" end="00:00:51.929">I'm getting to do all this<br />fun stuff and I'm learning</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.929" end="00:00:54.287">and that is just a tremendous experience.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.287" end="00:00:56.344">- I like the challenge of a word</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.344" end="00:00:59.003">and the most challenging part of my job</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.003" end="00:01:01.647">is when I am transcribing something</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.647" end="00:01:03.902">and they use a word that I don't know.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.902" end="00:01:07.003">I look it up and I want to<br />make sure I know what it is,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.003" end="00:01:09.187">that it fits the context of the sentence.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.187" end="00:01:11.169">Then, I try to - I do this with my kids.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.169" end="00:01:12.867">I try to use it.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.867" end="00:01:16.327">- I feel like I've gotten<br />to know Rev as a company</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.327" end="00:01:18.469">and the executives, even, at Rev</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.469" end="00:01:20.854">and it's nice to have that<br />more personal connection,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.854" end="00:01:22.700">even though it's such a big company.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.700" end="00:01:23.200">- You know what?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.200" end="00:01:24.750">They're real people.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.750" end="00:01:26.371">They're real people and I like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.371" end="00:01:28.559">They're real people and they<br />treat you like a real person.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.559" end="00:01:29.945">- I really was shocked.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:29.945" end="00:01:31.287">I called my husband and said,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:31.287" end="00:01:32.390">"Hey, not only did I get a job,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.390" end="00:01:33.453">"but I've already earned money today.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.453" end="00:01:34.772">"What do you think of that?"</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.772" end="00:01:38.321">You're always leery<br />about anything that says,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.321" end="00:01:39.298">"Work from home."</p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.298" end="00:01:41.390">It's got a negative connotation to it</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.390" end="00:01:44.000">and everybody thinks it's a scam,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.000" end="00:01:44.871">but Rev is not.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.871" end="00:01:45.745">It's not a scam.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.745" end="00:01:47.160">I truly get paid every week,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.160" end="00:01:49.871">which is also fantastic.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.871" end="00:01:52.253">- I did recently purchase<br />a house in Urbana</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.253" end="00:01:54.790">and that was a big commitment,</p>
      <p begin="00:01:54.790" end="00:01:58.999">a large part of which was<br />financed by my work with Rev.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:58.999" end="00:02:03.541">It's been great, not only in the<br />here and the now for the income,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.541" end="00:02:06.650">but also as a professional<br />development thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.650" end="00:02:08.957">It's invaluable, as far<br />as what it's going to do</p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.957" end="00:02:11.484">for my job security and my options</p>
      <p begin="00:02:11.484" end="00:02:15.882">when I get out of school and<br />start looking for full time work.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.882" end="00:02:19.000">- I don't miss school<br />appointments or school plays</p>
      <p begin="00:02:19.000" end="00:02:20.520">or that kind of thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.520" end="00:02:22.867">We don't miss soccer practice,<br />we don't miss soccer games.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.867" end="00:02:26.717">Those are benefits that<br />you can't get in an office.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.717" end="00:02:28.466">- I get to work for a living,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.466" end="00:02:30.919">earn some money, work<br />for a company I like,</p>
      <p begin="00:02:30.919" end="00:02:34.887">and pursue my passion, which is writing.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.887" end="00:02:37.647">I'm not sure how it can<br />get much better than that.</p>
